# GIO.G-Frontend

GIO.G is an open-source and configurable tool designed to streamline the modeling process and reduce manual effort, enabling researchers and practitioners to focus more on scenario exploration and analysis. GIO.G offers a systematic and automated approach to generating Indoor-Outdoor Graphs based on user-defined environmental parameters. This scalability extends to large environments, making GIO.G suitable for a wide range of urban modeling applications.

This repository houses the initial development of GIO.G's front-end user interface. To view the full web application, please visit [https://github.com/admtlab/GIO.G](https://github.com/admtlab/GIO.G).
